## A3Engine

Hey, this is my game made with C++ from scrath, what mean that I make a Game Engine in the backend with OpenGL, Jolt Physics and make a lot of systems to create this project. I would made some type of generic game engine with a complex editor to make any type of game, but it would take a long time.

My focus is only in gameplay things, I dont want work with good graphics like shadows and a good ilumination, at least not for now. My next features will be a pathnode system and A* to made some type of horror prototype with a AI that chase the player on the map.
